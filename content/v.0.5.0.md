## New Features

- **Delete Your Workouts:** You can now delete workouts youâ€™ve added. This feature is useful if you made a mistake or no longer want a workout in your records. However, be cautious - once deleted, a workout cannot be recovered, and your points will be recalculated. The workout will remain in the latest workouts feed until a certain number of new workouts have been added, after which it will be automatically removed.
