- **3 new exercises have been added to the App:** Bird Dog, Side Plank and Core Stabilizer. These exercises are now available for you to track your progress.

## Bird Dog
This essential core stability move enhances balance, coordination and deep core strength—perfect for improving posture and preventing lower back pain.

Starting in a quadruped position (on hands and knees), you extend one arm and the opposite leg while maintaining a neutral spine. The slow, controlled movement activates your core, glutes, and back muscles for improved full-body stability.

## Side Plank
The Side Plank is a powerful core exercise that targets the obliques, deep core, and shoulders, improving balance, stability, and posture. It’s also great for building core endurance and preventing lower back injuries.

How to Perform a Side Plank:

- Start: Lie on your side, legs straight, feet stacked, elbow under shoulder.
- Lift: Raise your hips, forming a straight line from head to heels.
- Hold: Maintain for 15-60 seconds, keeping core and glutes engaged.
- Switch: Repeat on the other side.

Stay stable and avoid sagging hips for best results!

## Core Stabilizer
The Core Stabilizer is a dynamic workout routine designed to strengthen and challenge your deep core muscles. It improves balance, stability and posture while boosting core endurance and reducing the risk of lower back injuries. This feature brings together multiple core-focused exercises, including the Bird Dog, Side Plank and more, giving you the tools to track and progress through a variety of core-strengthening movements.
