## BeProActive
A fully featured application emerged from a simple holiday project.

**BeProActive** is an attempt to develop a fitness and health tracking application on the Internet Computer with the goal of complete anonymity of its users.

An Internet Identity is the only thing you need. All your data is securely anonymous and bound to that specific Internet Identity.

Monitor your fitness activities and stay connected with friends through activity feeds. We currently offer 42 fitness activities and can expand our offerings upon request.

A leaderboard with a simple gamification aspect is included. Points are currently awarded as follows: 10 points per workout and 1 point per each exercise. Additional points can be incorporated as needed.

We hope you enjoy using the dApp and that it becomes a valuable tool to support your fitness and health goals.
